      The reason you have an RV is to travel and get close to the place you want to visit. You are
      practical and realize you can have a great vacation while not breaking the bank. However, often when
      you arrive, you have trouble finding a decent RV park that is near where you want to be.

You would have to park your RV in several parks that are outside the city. Well if you know anything about the DC Metro area, it can take an extra hour and a half to two hours to commute in from the local RV parks.
