    question: Does UpClose-RV provide insurance for property owners?

    question: As a host do I have to have RV hook up for my guests?
    answer: "While hook-ups are convenient for your guests they are not necessary.  Most RVs come with internal holding tanks for both sewage and fresh water.  They also traditionally come with batteries,  Some even come with solar panels.  Generally, your guests will be self sufficient...that's the kind of people they are :)"

    question: 'Do I have to have a large property or lots of  acreage to be a host?'
    answer: 'No.  There are many small RVs out there. If  you have space in your driveway that will fit some of these then there is opportunity for you to be a host.  Just make sure you get an accurate measurement of the space you are going to provide so that potential travelers get a good idea whether they can fit before they arrive.  PICTURES, PICTURES, PICTURES. Make sure you upload good photos to entice perspective guests. '
