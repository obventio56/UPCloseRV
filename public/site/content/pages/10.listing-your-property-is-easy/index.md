      <h2>What to expect as a property owner</h2><p>This is a great revenue builder for a homeowner or landowner. The US national average night stay at an RV site runs about $29 a night and depending on locality and amenities, can be over $100 a night or more. Think about what that could mean for you as the home owner.<br></p><h2>Insurance equals assurance:</h2><p>What makes UpClose-RV so different? First, unlike other similar businesses, your guests do not generally enter your home. They are sleeping and cooking in their own home-away-from -home. This is more comfortable for them and for you. However, in the event that the rare accident happens it is important to have appropriate insurance. Normally accidents can be covered by your homeowners insurance or vehicle insurance. However, we recommend that the home owner looks at getting a "host" insurance plan. We recommend:....[company name]</p><h2>Community and legal considerations.</h2><p>One of the first questions a prospective host might ask is "is it legal?" Yes, but it is up to the property owner to ensure they are in compliance with any local ordinances. For example, some homeowner associations don't even allow you to put your own RV in your drive way. So be sure to check.</p><h2>What about the yucky parts?</h2><p>Another question prospective hosts have are concerns about bath and shower waste. The truth is that most RVs have their own internal holding tanks. Many even bring their own water and electricity (called dry camping) with them. However, one consideration you should include when setting up your account is to be sure that your guests know where the closest dumping station is so that either before or after their stay they can freshen up their rolling home.</p><h2>Utility hook ups.</h2><p>If you do decide to let your guests hook their RV up to your home utilities, this can be done easily. Most experienced travelers will come with their own connectors (i.e. potable water hose, electrical adapter, and extension cord). They can hook up to an external outlet and faucet on the house and in some cases the sewer bypass on the property.</p>
