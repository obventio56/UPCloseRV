    bard: '<h2>Earning Potential!</h2><p>The amount you can earn varies on many factors.. These factors include amenities, proximity to interesting sites or activities (like auto shows, fairs, outdoor concerts, or maybe other venues like Sturgis Bike rally or the Kentucky Derby). However as an example, if you were to provide space for just the weekends at the national average campsite rate of about $29, you could supplement your income by a couple of hundred dollars a month just for letting someone park their RV in your driveway or on your property. As another example, suppose you live near a national park. You know that at the height of tourist season RV parking is at a premium. How much could you charge? We have seen RV parks charge over $100 (Hershey Park) a night!<br></p>'
