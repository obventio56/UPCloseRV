      <h2>Why start this business you might ask?<br></h2><p>Well, simply put...there is a need. Something that I discovered in my last two years of almost a 40 year career in the military. After years of following me around, my wife of 27 years decided she had had enough of moving. Especially after finding the community in Carlisle, PA (Where I had attended United States Army War College), so welcoming. After graduation, the Army decided that I needed to return to the Pentagon for another stint in that cement city. But this time, I would be going without my lovely wife. So, in trying to figure out how I was going to manage the cost of two households I decided to buy a used travel trailer and park it near my new assignment. I love my little trailer, a 26ft Keystone Ultralight, but then I began to try an find a place to camp it. Easy, huh? Well yes and no, I could find places to park but not many long term. I found two places that would let me park for a longer period. The first one was just a dump and the trailers packed in next to each other like sardines. The second one in was acceptable. Both were at least an hour and a half commute (often two hours). Every morning and afternoon while on the road I would ask myself, "isn't there a better way"? I also took notice that there were many homes along the route that could easily allow me to park "bell" (the name I gave to my trailer; my truck I named blue, thus Bluebell..the name of my favorite ice-cream) on their property. I even saw many with their own RVs in their driveways or properties. These thoughts gave me the idea for upCLOSE-RV.</p><p>Sincerely,&nbsp;<br>Mike Lockwood</p>
